                            Linear switches are very smooth with with no bump when pressing down. Linear
                            switches have a very short actuation point and often are the preferred choice of professional
                            gamers by nature of the switches speed. The switches shown above are the very popular NovelKey 
                            Cream Switches.

                            Clicky switches are exactly what they say they are...CLICKY! With their loud and recognizable
                            sound, clicky switches are much more of a personal preference in terms of its popularity. Users tend
                            to either love clicky switches or hate them. Shown above are the notorious Box Jade Switches.

                            Tactile switches are by far the most popular type of switch in the keyboard community.
                            Known for it's signature bump and thocky noise, tactile switches provide both a satisfying
                            feel and sound that users can't get enough of. Shown above are the cream of the crop Holy Panda Switches.

                    Keycaps are what allow keyboard users to express their true sense of style. With so many different
                    types of keycaps, builders are really able to narrow down their prefernces. Keycaps are most commonly known
                    for their Cherry profile, but also have other shapes and sizes in profiles like SA, MT3, and DSA.
                    Different profiles lead to different sounds, making the keyboard building experience that much more 
                    personal! Highlighted below is my favorite set: GMK Striker.
